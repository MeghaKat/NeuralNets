# NeuralNets
Investigate Classification Performance of neural nets
# NueralNets using Numpy
### Objective
Implement and train a neural network to classify the letters using Numpy and Gradient Descent with Momentum. The network implemented
has the following structure:
   3 layers - 1 input, 1 hidden with ReLU activation and 1 output with Softmax
   Cross Entropy Loss
